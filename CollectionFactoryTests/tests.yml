# All of the tests are generated from this file. As part of the Xcode build the
# scipt `generate_tests.py` is run that generates the
# `CollectionFactoryTests.m`.
# 
# 
# Test Classes
# ------------
# 
# Each of the keys under `tests` represent the actual Objective-C classes. For
# each class there will be a set of automatic test cases generated:
# 
#   1. Invalid JSON string to object - tries to send an invalid chunk of JSON,
#      in this case "[123" to make sure that `nil` is returned.
#   2. Invalid JSON data to object - works the same way as above but sends the
#      same input as an `NSData`.
#   3. Nil JSON string to object - tries to send a `nil` JSON object that
#      should always return a `nil`.
#   4. Nil JSON data to object - works the same as number 3 but sends `nil` to
#      the respective NSData endpoint.
#      
# Note: The test classes are case-sensitive and must reflect classes that exist.
#      
#      
# Test Cases
# ----------
# 
# Beneath each Test Class the actual test cases. For each test case there will
# be several test cases generated that will test the expression is converted
# correctly in both directions (to and from JSON).
# 
# Note: The test case should have a sentence-case name so that when it is put
# into the actual test name it follows the case of the surrounding words.
# 
# 
# Single Test Case
# ----------------
# 
# In each single test case you will need two keys;
# 
#   * `object` is the Objective-C code uses to generate the object to be
#     converted to JSON.
#   * `json` is the string output of the `object` encoded as JSON.
# 
# Note: When it generates mutable tests it will wrap the `object` in a
# [mutableCopy] to generate its mutable version.
#
# If the `object` is "nil" then test are only generated to assert that the JSON
# string/data will return `nil` and not test the other direction (since this
# would be impossible.)
# 
# Each of the JSON values will be wrapped in a variety of whitespace characters
# to ensure they do not mess with the string/data to object conversions.

tests:
  NSString:
    String:
      object: '@"foo bar"'
      json: '\"foo bar\"'
    DoubleQuotes:
      object: '@"foo \"bar"'
      json: '\"foo \\\"bar\"'

  NSArray:
    Array:
      object: '@[@123, @"foo"]'
      json: '[123,\"foo\"]'

    # Make sure that we are explicitly parsing an array so it will return `nil`
    # if the JSON is valid but not of the correct type.
    InvalidArray:
      object: 'nil'
      json: '{\"abc\":\"def\"}'

  NSDictionary:
    Dictionary:
      object: '@{@"abc": @"def"}'
      json: '{\"abc\":\"def\"}'

    # Make sure that we are explicitly parsing a dictionary so it will return
    # `nil` if the JSON is valid but not of the correct type.
    InvalidDictionary:
      object: 'nil'
      json: '[123,\"foo\"]'

  # NSObject and NSNumber do not have a Mutable counterpart so no mutable tests
  # will be genrated for them.
  NSObject:
    ObjectNull:
      object: "[NSNull null]"
      json: "null"
    ObjectYes:
      object: "@YES"
      json: "true"
    ObjectNo:
      object: "@NO"
      json: "false"
    ObjectInteger:
      object: "@123"
      json: "123"

  NSNumber:
    Yes:
      object: "[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]"
      json: "true"
    No:
